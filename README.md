Exploring how GitHub works.

## About Me
Hi! I'm **Renato**, an aspiring Junior Python Developer and Data Science enthusiast. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **SQL**. I'm currently focused on building hands-on projects to strengthen my skills and create a solid foundation in data analysis and reporting.

This is my **first time using GitHub**, so I'm still learning the ropes â€” exploring how version control works and how I can use this platform effectively.  
Though I'm not yet fully knowledgeable, I'm excited to learn and grow through consistent practice and experience.

This repository serves as my starting point in the journey to becoming a skilled Python developer.
